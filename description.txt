Discord Moderation Bot - Detailed Project Description 🚀
Project Overview
This project is a Discord moderation bot designed to maintain order in a server by implementing several features:

Banned words detection and automatic message deletion.
Spam detection and message purging.
Warnings system with auto-muting after reaching a threshold.
Administrator commands for managing banned words and clearing messages.
Automatic role management, including a Muted role.
Features & Functionalities
1️⃣ Banned Words Detection
The bot maintains a database of banned words.
If a user sends a message containing a banned word, the bot:
Deletes the message immediately.
Sends a warning to the user.
Logs the event in the console for debugging.
2️⃣ Spam Detection
The bot monitors the frequency of messages per user.
If a user sends too many messages in a short interval, the bot:
Deletes spam messages automatically.
Issues a warning to the user.
Prevents further spam by tracking message frequency.
3️⃣ Warnings System & Auto-Mute
Each violation (banned words or spam) adds a warning to the user.
If a user reaches 5 warnings, they are:
Automatically muted for 5 minutes.
Warnings are reset immediately upon mute.
The bot handles permissions to prevent muted users from sending messages.
4️⃣ Role Management
The bot creates a "Muted" role automatically if it doesn’t exist.
This role is configured to block users from sending messages in all channels.
After 5 minutes, the bot removes the "Muted" role, allowing the user to chat again.
5️⃣ Admin Commands
The bot provides several commands for administrators to manage the server:

Command	Description
!addword <word>	Adds a new banned word to the database.
!removeword <word>	Removes a word from the banned words list.
!listwords	Displays all banned words in the database.
!warnings	Shows the current number of warnings for the user.
!clear <amount>	Deletes a specified number of messages from a channel.
6️⃣ Error Handling & Stability
The bot catches and logs errors to prevent crashes.
Errors like missing permissions are handled gracefully.
If the bot shuts down unexpectedly, it logs the event.
Technical Implementation
1. Database Management (SQLite)
Stores banned words and user warnings.
Uses SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data.
Ensures data persistence across bot restarts.
2. Discord Bot Commands
Uses discord.py and the commands extension.
Implements role management, message tracking, and command processing.
3. Async Programming (asyncio)
The bot uses async functions to handle tasks efficiently.
Implements timeouts, delayed actions, and parallel processing.
4. Error Handling
try-except blocks ensure the bot doesn’t crash.
Provides clear error messages in the console.
How It Works - Step-by-Step
🏁 Startup Process
The bot connects to Discord and loads all required permissions.
It checks if the "Muted" role exists and creates it if necessary.
It fetches banned words from the database.
The bot prints a "Ready" message when everything is initialized.
📩 Message Handling
Every message sent in the server is checked for banned words.
If a banned word is found, the bot deletes the message and warns the user.
If the user reaches 5 warnings, the bot mutes them for 5 minutes.
🚫 Spam Detection
The bot tracks message timestamps per user.
If a user sends too many messages within a short time, they are flagged for spam.
The bot deletes spam messages and adds a warning.
🔨 Administrator Controls
Admins can add or remove banned words using commands.
Admins can clear messages if needed.
The bot ensures only authorized users can modify the banned word list.
Why This Bot is Useful?
Keeps servers safe by blocking offensive words.
Prevents spam from overwhelming chat.
Automates moderation, reducing admin workload.
Maintains order by warning and muting rule-breakers.
Future Improvements
Logging system to track user violations.
Custom mute durations based on severity.
Integration with external moderation APIs.
Final Thoughts
This Discord moderation bot is a powerful tool for managing a server efficiently. It automates moderation tasks, protects the chat from spam and banned words, and ensures a clean and friendly environment.
